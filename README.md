## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned

I had fun working with designs. I think i had more fun learning work with JSON file format which was used to dynamically populate the summary contents.

### Continued development

1. I had tough time naming boxed in html. I hope seniors can see my work and guide me on how to name thing properly.
2. I also couldn't get the box to be in center in my large monitor 27 inch. Even though I set the body to flex, justify-flex, align-center, and width and height 100vw, 100vh respectively.
